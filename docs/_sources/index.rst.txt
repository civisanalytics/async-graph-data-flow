``async-graph-data-flow`` is a Python library for executing asynchronous functions
that pass data along a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Features
--------

* **Functions organized as a graph** üï∏

Your asynchronous functions are nodes in the DAG.
Each node yields data to its destination nodes.

* **Let data flow along the graph** ü•Ç

It's like how champagne flows along a champagne tower.
Graph execution continues as long as there's still data between two connected nodes.

* **Customizable start nodes** üß®

By default, graph execution begins with nodes that have no incoming nodes,
but you can choose to start the graph execution from any nodes.

* **Data flow statistics** ‚è≥

Utilities are available to keep track of data volumes at each node
and optionally log such info at a regular time interval.

* **Exception handling** üí•

Choose whether to halt execution at a specific node or any node.

* **Lightweight** ü™∂

The source code is only about 400 lines!

* **Pure Python** üêç

The library is built on top of ``asyncio`` from the Python standard library, with no third-party dependencies.

Download and Install
--------------------

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install async-graph-data-flow

Usage
-----

Start with :ref:`quickstart`, and then get inspired by :ref:`more_examples`.
Don't forget to check out the :ref:`api` as well.

Under the Hood
--------------

``async-graph-data-flow`` chains asynchronous functions together
with a :class:`~asyncio.Queue` instance between two functions in the graph.
A queue keeps track of the data items yielded from a source node and feeds them
into its destination node.
