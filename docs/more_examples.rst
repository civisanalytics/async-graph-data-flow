More Examples
=============

While some of the examples below are meant to demonstrate the features
of the ``async-graph-data-flow`` library,
others (e.g., running a synchronous function, sharing state across functions)
show what could be possible -- we aren't limited by the implemented features!
If you have questions or would like to contribute an example of your own,
please open an issue at the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/civisanalytics/async-graph-data-flow>`_
for discussion.
